<h1>Using Custom Data With The Traveller Map</h1>
<div class="content">

  <div>
    <p>
      While the Traveller Map displays the sectors of the <cite>Official
      Traveller Universe</cite> (OTU), it also provides tools for referees who have
      created custom sectors.
    </p>

    <p class="aside">
      It is not possible to display custom data on the main map
      itself. But if you have created custom data and wish to include
      it on the map, consider <a href="./submit">submitting your data</a>
      for inclusion.
    </p>
  </div>

  <section>
    <h2>Using Custom Data</h2>
    <p>
      While the following tools can be used with OTU sectors, they also
      let you enter custom data and metadata for your own sectors:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt><a target=_blank href="../make/poster">Poster Maker</a></dt>
      <dd>Create posters for display on screen or print-quality PDFs.</dd>

      <dt><a target=_blank href="../make/booklet">Booklet Maker</a></dt>
      <dd>Create printable booklets describing each subsector in the sector.</dd>

      <dt><a target=_blank href="../make/poster">Path Finder</a></dt>
      <dd>Find paths across a sector for ships with a given Jump rating.</dd>
    </dl>
  </section>


  <section>
    <h2>Creating Sector Data</h2>
    <p>
      Sectors in <cite>Traveller</cite> are described using the
      <a href="./secondsurvey">Second Survey Data</a> format. This defines
      the fields such as UWP, Remarks, Bases and so forth. It is assumed
      that referees are familiar with these fields from the various
      <cite>Traveller</cite> rules.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h3>Data File Formats</h3>
      <p>
        Several sector data formats can be used with the Traveller Map:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a target=_blank href="./fileformats#genie-format-sunbane">GEnie</a></li>
        <li><a target=_blank href="./fileformats#legacy-sec-format">SEC</a></li>
        <li><a target=_blank href="./fileformats#t5-tab-delimited-format">T5 Tab Delimited</a></li>
        <li><a target=_blank href="./fileformats#t5-column-delimited-format">T5 Column Delimited</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The T5 formats (Tab and Column delimited) are the most precisely specified,
        support any field lengths (important for names and remarks) and the easiest
        to create with tools such as spreadsheets.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Checking Your Data</h3>
      <p>
        To ensure your data has no errors, use the
        <a target=_blank href="../tools/lintsec.html">Sector "Lint" Tool</a>.
        It will provide detailed feedback on issues noted in the sector data,
        such as missing columns and unexpected values, and will report which
        file format was detected.
      </p>
      <p class="aside">
        Note that even if T5 data formats are used, custom allegiance
        codes should still be only two characters. Four-character
        codes are assigned by the T5SS and unknown codes are treated
        as errors.
      </p>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Creating Sector Metadata</h2>
    <p>
      Beyond the Second Survey Data (described above) which details the
      worlds, additional information is needed to fully describe out sectors.
      This is known as <dfn>metadata</dfn> and includes subsector names,
      routes, borders and labels.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h3>Metadata File Formats</h3>
      <p>
        The Traveller Map supports two data formats for metadata:
        MSEC and XML.
      </p>

      <p>
        The MSEC format was created by J. Greely and is used in his
        <a target="_blank" href="http://dotclue.org/t20/">sec2pdf</a> tool
        for generating PDF sector maps. The format is a plain text file,
        defined by example:
        <a target="_blank" href="http://dotclue.org/t20/SpinwardMarches.txt">SpinwardMarches.txt</a>.
        Note that most but not all features of MSEC are supported by the
        Traveller Map.
      </p>

      <p>
        The XML format is defined for the Traveller Map and is specified
        in detail in the <a href="./metadata">Sector Metadata File Format</a>
        document. The XML format is more complicated, but is recommended
        and fully supported by the Traveller Map, and includes additional
        features beyond those in MSEC.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Authoring Metadata</h3>

      <p>
        To author XML metadata, follow the template in
        <a href="./metadata">Sector Metadata File Format</a>. You can use
        these tools to help author the route and border sections:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a target=_blank href="../make/borders">Border Maker</a></li>
        <li><a target=_blank href="../make/routes">Route Maker</a></li>
      </ul>
