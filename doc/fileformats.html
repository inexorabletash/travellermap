<h1>The Traveller Map - Sector Data File Formats</h1>

<div class="content">

<section id="intro">
<p>
For convenience, the <cite>Traveller</cite> universe is divided into
<dfn>sectors</dfn>. A sector comprises a region of space 32 by 40
hexagonal parsecs on a side, covering a total area of 1280
"hexes". Outside stellar rifts, the density in charted space is around
40%, giving around 500 systems per sector.  Each system can be
conveniently described by a compact format including the name and
details of the main world in the system, plus additional data about
the star system - generally referred to as a
<dfn>Universal World Profile</dfn> or "UWP".
</p>

<p>
For 30 years, <cite>Traveller</cite> sector data has been published
and shared. A variety of similar data formats have been used. Due
to the MS-DOS convention of using file names with a dot and three
letter suffix to indicate the type of file, sector data files are
often referred to as <dfn>SEC files</dfn>. Various formats are
in use, often with extremely subtle differences. This document
attempts to provide details of each format.
</p>

<p class="aside">
This document does not fully define the meaning of each element of
each data format. The companion document

<h2>TRADER Format</h2>

<p>
The original electronic format for sector data was defined
by Marc Miller in <em>"Electronically Exploring the Traveller Universe"</em>
<cite>Challenge Magazine, Issue No. 26</cite>, pp.24-25. The sector
generator program listing generated files matching this format.
The format was also used in the <strong>TRADER</strong> game/utilty
published by GDW for the Apple II computer system. The disk included
<code>SPINWARD</code> and <code>SOLOMANI</code> data files for
the two published sectors.
</p>

<p>
Notably absent from this early format is the world name,
possibly for space reasons. The allegiance code precedes the base
code, but already the format is easily recognizable.
This format corresponds closely to the data from <cite>Classic Traveller</cite>
  publications such as <cite>Supplement 3: The Spinward Marches</cite>
  and <cite>Supplement 10: The Solomani Rim</cite>.
</p>

<p>
The format utilizes ASCII encoding; each character takes one byte and
accented characters and non-Latin characters are not supported.
Fields are fixed width, left aligned, and padded with spaces (ASCII
32). Records are also padded to ensure that each record occupies the
same number of bytes; this allows programs to load specific records by
index without loading the entire file, a critical requirement for the
limited computer systems available at the time.

<p>
Following the introduction of this format, <cite>Traveller</cite>
standard world data expanded to include several new fields such
as "PBG" (population multiplier, number of planetoid belts,
number of gas giants) and stellar data, culiminating in the
data published in GDW's <cite>The Spinward Marches Campaign</cite>.
</p>

</section>

<section id="genie">
<h2>GEnie Format ("Sunbane") </h2>

<p>
Joe Fugate of Digest Group Publications generated data for the
Imperium and several surrounding sectors, 35 in total. This data was
made available to the public by uploading to the GEnie information
service. It was later hosted on an FTP file server named "Sunbane".
This dataset is often referred to as "GENII" <i>(sic)</i> or most commonly
"the Sunbane data".
</p>

<p>
This format includes the PBG code (population multiplier, number of
planetoid belts, number of gas giants), stellar data, and of course
the mainworld  name. Note that a long world name may be truncated,
and there is not necessarily a blank between the name and hex
location, and names may be truncated to fit.

This format corresponds closely to that present in <cite>Classic Traveller</cite>,
<cite>MegaTraveller</cite>, <cite>Traveller: The New Era</cite> and
  <cite>Marc Miller's Traveller (T4)</cite> publications
  such as
  <cite>The Spinward Marches Campaign</cite>,
  <cite>MegaTraveller Alien: Vilani &amp; Vargr</cite>,
  <cite>The Regency Sourcebook</cite> (TNE) and
  <cite>Second Survey</cite> (T4).
</p>


<p>
This is a line-oriented, plain text, fixed-width format.

The format utilizes the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252">Windows-1252</a>
encoding, so each character takes one byte and Western European
accented characters are supported, but non-Latin characters are not.

Lines may be terminated with LF (ASCII 10) or CR+LF (ASCII 13, ASCII 10).

Each column has a fixed number of characters, padded with spaces
(ASCII 32) as necessary.  Trailing spaces at the end of a line may be
truncated.
</p>

<p>
The file helpfully includes a self-documenting, multi-line header:

<h2>Legacy SEC Format</h2>

<p>
As the introduction to this document alludes, the is no one true SEC file format.
Various applications have taken canonical name/hex/uwp/bases/codes/zone/pbg/allegiance/stellar
fields and applied various field widths. It is valuable to document a generalized
version of this format which applications can consume.
</p>

<p>
This is a line-oriented, plain text, variable-width format.

The format utilizes the Windows-1252 encoding, so each character takes
one byte and Western European accented characters are supported,
but non-Latin characters are not.

Lines may be terminated with LF (ASCII 10) or CR+LF (ASCII 13, ASCII 10).

Blanks may be spaces (ASCII 32) or tabs (ASCII 9).
</p>

<p>
To accomodate legacy files, this format does not define field widths. Instead,
parsers must inspect lines using Regular Expressions (or equivalent logic) to identify
the fields. The regular expressions here follow the
<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html">Perl 5 extended regular expression syntax</a>
which has become a de-facto standard in many programming environments.
</p>

<p>
For each line in the file:
<ul>
<li>Trailing whitespace on each line should be removed
<li>Blank lines should be ignored
<li>Lines starting with <code>#</code> (ASCII 35) should be ignored (comments in some applications)
<li>Lines starting with <code>$</code> (ASCII 36) should be ignored (routes in some applications)
<li>Lines starting with <code>@</code> (ASCII 64) should be ignored (subsectors in some applications)
<li>Lines matching the following regular expression produce the named fields.
<li>Other lines should be ignored. They may contain errors, or be comments.
</ul>

<pre class="code">
^
( \s*       (?&lt;Name&gt;       .*                            ) )
( \s*       (?&lt;Hex&gt;        \d\d\d\d                      ) )
( \s{1,2}   (?&lt;UWP&gt;        [ABCDEX][0-9A-Z]{6}-[0-9A-Z]  ) )
( \s{1,2}   (?&lt;Base&gt;       [A-Z1-9* ]                    ) )
( \s{1,2}   (?&lt;Remarks&gt;    .{10,}?                       ) )
( \s+       (?&lt;Zone&gt;       [GARBFU]                      ) )?
( \s{1,2}   (?&lt;PBG&gt;        \d[0-9A-F][0-9A-F]            ) )
( \s{1,2}   (?&lt;Allegiance&gt; (\w\w\b|\w-|--)               ) )
( \s*       (?&lt;Stars&gt;      .*?                           ) )
\s*$
</pre>

<o>
The complexity associated with the regular expression  merits discussion:

<ul>
<li>For simplicity, <cite>Traveller</cite> eHex codes are matched as
<code>[0-9A-Z]</code>. More strictly, this should be: <code>[0-9A-HJ-NP-Z]</code>
<li>Name: Some files include <code>+</code> (ASCII 43) after the name to signify special
characteristics. T4-era files terminate the name with <code>.</code> (ASCII 46).
Some files use the hex location (e.g. <code>0133</code>) as a placeholder when the name
is not known. Applications should filter all of these.
<li>Base: Some files include <code>*</code> (ASCII 42)
<li>Remarks: A minimum width is imposed; otherwise a world with a base and
no codes cannot be distinguished from a world with a zone and no codes.
<li>Zone: Includes additional codes:
<ul>
<li><code>A</code> = Amber
<li><code>R</code> = Red
<li><code>B</code> = <cite>Traveller: The New Era</cite> <dfn>Technologically Elevated Dictatorship</dfn> (a.k.a. "Blue")
<li><code>F</code> = Forbidden (Zhodani)
<li><code>U</code> = Unabsorbed (Zhodani)
</ul>
<li>PBG: P must be <code>0</code>-<code>9</code>, but B and G can be eHex codes
<li>Many files fail to separate fields. It is common to "run together" the
zone, PBG and allegiance codes (e.g. <code>R456Im</code>). (NOTE: The above regular
expression does not account for this.)
<li>Stars: many stellar data formats are in use; some use
additional glyphs to indicate the pair and near/far companions, as well as
identifying the mainworld's star. Also, many files include non-stellar
data as extensions. Additional parsing may be applied to distinguish these from
stellar data, using the following regular expression:
</ul>

<p>
This approach is not perfect. Many fields end up with the codes and
zone fields running together.

<pre class="code">

</pre>

<p>
From experience, files are "messy". Numerous files transcribed (by hand or
via OCR) from print publications contain errors, such as
<code>I</code>/<code>1</code>/<code>l</code> or <code>0</code>/<code>O</code>.
It is strongly encouraged that applications which consume legacy SEC files be
made robust against such errors and report parse errors in a useful way to
the users.

<p>
The following are some example legacy SEC data file entries found
on the Internet, with comments:

</pre>

<p>
Despite the allowances in the de-facto format for variable width fields,
it is strongly recommended that applications output individual sector files
with fixed width columns. Care should be taken to avoid truncating any
fields. A pre-processing step which determines the maximum length of the
name and remarks field may be necessary prior to serializing any of the lines
in the file. In addition, a minimum field width for name and remarks should
be selected, both to aid in reading the file (for example, in the case where
no systems are named) and to avoid collapsing the base, remarks, and zone
columns.
</p>

<p>
It is also conventional to include a human-readable header which
contains information about the file, including identifying the fields,
identifying the sector, and possibly other information such as author,
source, subsector names, etc.

<h2>T5 Tab Delimited Format</h2>

<p>
<cite>Traveller<sup>5</sup></cite> introduces several new fields
beyond those in previous editions of <cite>Traveller</cite>, and are
of course documented in the <cite>Traveller<sup>5</sup> Core Rulebook</cite>.
These include: Economic extension, Cultural extension, Importance extension,
Nobility, and World count. In addition, the <dfn><cite>Traveller<sup>5</sup> Second Survey</cite></dfn>
(T5SS) is established to define a consistent, official data set for licensees
and players. This allows us to establish a canonical data format.
</p>

<p>
The format utilizes the UTF-8 encoding. Therefore, each character may
take more than one byte, but all of Earth's writing systems can be
represented using <a href="http://unicode.org">Unicode</a>.

This is a line-oriented, plain text,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values">tab-delimited</a> format.

Lines in the file are terminated with either LF (U+000A) or CR+LF (U+000D, U+000A).

Every line in the file has fields separated by the Tab character
(U+0009). There is no escaping mechanism &ndash; neither tabs nor line
breaking characters may occur within fields. Comments are not supported.
Blank lines should be ignored.
</p>

<p>
The first line in the file is the <dfn>header</dfn>; it is tab-delimited
and defines the fields. The fields do not appear in a fixed order.
Parsers should read the header line and use it to construct a
field index to field name mapping for use with the rest of the file.

<p>
Note that the "extension" fields (Ix, Ex, Cx) are given visually distinct
wrapper characters. This is convention to distinguish the fields when data is
in print format. Due to the complexity of parsing legacy SEC files, the use
of tab-delimited format for T5 Second Survey data is strongly recommended.
</p>

<p>
Additional columns may be present, containing convenient but redundant data.
These commonly include:
<ul>
  <li><b>Sector</b> - sector abbreviation (4 letters)
<li><b>SS</b> - subsector (<code>A</code> - <code>P</code>)
<li><b>RU</b> - Resource Units (calculated from Economic Extension)
</ul>

<h2>T5 Column Delimited Format</h2>

<p>
Although the tab-delimited format is the most convenient for interchange
it is difficult for humans to read. This document establishes an extensible,
human-readable plain text format for the
<dfn><cite>Traveller<sup>5</sup></cite> Second Survey</dfn> data.
</p>

<p>
The format utilizes the UTF-8 encoding. Therefore, each character may
take more than one byte, but all of Earth's writing systems can be
represented using <a href="http://unicode.org">Unicode</a>.
This is a variable-width, line-oriented format. Fields are fixed
width, separated by one space, left aligned and padded by spaces.
Lines in the file are terminated with either LF
(U+000A) or CR+LF (U+000D, U+000A).
There is no escaping mechanism line breaking characters may occur within fields.
</p>

<p>
Blank lines are ignored. Lines starting with <code>#</code> (U+0023) are ignored.
</p>

<p>
The first non-ignored line in the file is the <dfn>header line</dfn>.
It establishes
the field names. The header line is composed of field
names padded by spaces. The header line is followed by a
<dfn>separator line</dfn> which defines the field widths.
The separator line is composed of runs of <code>-</code> (U+002D)
characters separated by space characters (U+0020).
To parse the file, the header line should be saved, then the
separator line parsed to determine field widths and offsets.
The header line can then be parsed to determine field names.
The fields do not appear in a fixed order; after parsing
the separator line and the header line, a field index to field
name mapping can be constructed to use for parsing the rest of
the file.
</p>

<p>
The rest of the non-ignored lines in the file are
<dfn>data lines</dfn> and are parsed using the fields and widths
determined by parsing the header line.
</p>

<p>
The following is an example header line, separator line, and data
line:
