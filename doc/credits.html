      The Official <cite>Traveller</cite> Universe (OTU) is comprised
      of materials published by licensees, although these may be
      decanonized or overwritten by later materials. The following
      section is presented in roughly chronological order to
      illustrate the evolution of the OTU data corpus over time.
    </p>

    <p class=aside>
      Ongoing review and development of the OTU is being coordinated
      by the Traveller<sup>5</sup> Sector Survey (T5SS), an effort
      driven by Marc Miller to stabilize, correct, and control the
      UWPs of the OTU so that there's a solid canon base of data for
      future reference. Feedback should be directed to:

      The Judges Guild published four approved sector supplements
