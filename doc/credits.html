    <p>
      The Official <cite>Traveller</cite> Universe (OTU) is comprised
      of materials published by licensees, although these may be
      decanonized or overwritten by later materials. The following
      section is presented in roughly chronological order to
      illustrate the evolution of the OTU data corpus over time.
    </p>

    <p class=aside>
      Ongoing review and development of the OTU is being coordinated
      by the Traveller<sup>5</sup> Sector Survey (T5SS), an effort
      driven by Marc Miller to stabilize, correct, and control the
      UWPs of the OTU so that there's a solid canon base of data for
      future reference. Feedback should be directed to:

    <h2>Borders and Routes</h2>
    <!-- ================================================================================ -->

    <p>
      Where possible, polity borders and communication/trade routes
      shown on maps in previous publications have been used. Unlike
      the raw system data, there is no standard data format for
      representing these. Where not previously available, borders have
      been automatically generated -
      see <a href="../borders/">Improved Automatic Border Generation
      for TRAVELLER Sectors</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a class=sector>Antares</a> and <a class=sector>Fornast</a>
      sector routes were designed by Jeff Zeitlin,
      from <a href="http://www.zho.berka.com/">The Zhodani Base</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a class=sector>Delphi</a> routes designed by Thomas
      Jones-Low, for the <cite>Journal of the Travellers' Aid
      Society.</cite>
    </p>

    <p>
      Routes in the Julian Protectorate for the
      <a class=sector>Amdukan</a>, <a class=sector>Mendan</a>, <a class=sector>Arzul</a> and <a class=sector>Star's End</a> sectors
      were designed and submitted by Mike Kuehn.
