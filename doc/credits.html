      The Official <cite>Traveller</cite> Universe (OTU) is comprised
      of materials published by licensees, although these may be
      decanonized or overwritten by later materials. The following
      section is presented in roughly chronological order to
      illustrate the evolution of the OTU data corpus over time.
    </p>

    <p class="aside">
      Ongoing review and development of the OTU is being coordinated
      by the Traveller<sup>5</sup> Sector Survey (T5SS), an effort
      driven by Marc Miller to stabilize, correct, and control the
      UWPs of the OTU so that there's a solid canon base of data for
      future reference. Feedback should be directed to:

    <h4>Spinward Sectors</h4>

    <p>
      The <a class="sector">Beyond</a> and <a class="sector">Vanguard Reaches</a>
      sectors were designed by Donald P. Rapp and Chuck Kallenbach II
      respectively, and featured in two approved sector supplements
      of the same names published by Paranoia Press. They can be found in
      the <a target="_blank"

      Alsas subsector was designed by Bill Fawcett, and published

      The Judges Guild published four approved sector supplements
      "Approved For Use With Traveller" by GDW,
      comprising what was called the Gateway Quadrant:
      <cite>Ley Sector</cite>, <cite>Maranatha-Alkahest</cite>,
      <cite>Glimmerdrift Reaches</cite> and <cite>Crucis
      Margin</cite>. While the names and locations of three of the
      sectors were retained for the OTU, most of the data was replaced by
      later publications. The Judges Guild versions of these sectors
      can be found on the <a target="_blank"
      href="http://farfuture.net/Contents%20CDROM%20Apocrypha-2.pdf">Traveller
      Apocrypha II</a> collection
      by <a href="http://farfuture.net">Far Future Enterprises</a>, as
      well as on the map, located far away from charted space:
      <a class="sector">Ley (Judges Guild)</a>,
      <a class="sector">Glimmerdrift Reaches (Judges Guild)</a>,
      <a class="sector">Crucis Margin (Judges Guild)</a>,
