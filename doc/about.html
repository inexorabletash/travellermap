<h1>The Traveller Map</h1>
<div class="content">

    <p>
      <cite>Traveller</cite> is a role-playing game set against a
      background drawn from adventure oriented science fiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the distant future, interstellar travel is as common as
      international travel is today. The tremendous distances involved
      in travel between the stars dictate that such voyages take
      weeks, months, and even years. A situation similar to Earth in
      the eighteenth century is created, where communication is
      limited to the speed of travel, and the stage is set for
      adventure in a grand fashion, with all the trappings of classic
      science fiction: giant, star-spanning empires (good, evil, or
      both), huge starfleets, wily interstellar merchants (or pirates,
      depending on your point of view), complex diplomatic maneuvers,
      larger-than-life heroes, heroines, and villains.

    <h2>The Traveller Universe</h2>
    <p>
      The <dfn>Official Traveller Universe</dfn> (OTU) is the primary
      setting for various editions of the <cite>Traveller</cite> game,
      controlled by Far Future Enterprises (FFE). This is the universe
      described by publications from GDW and FFE, and by past
      licensees such as Digest Group, FASA, Imperium Games and others,
      The setting includes the Third Imperium, Zhodani Consulate and
      Solomani Confederation, alien species such as the Aslan, K'kree,
      Vargr, Hivers and Droyne, and a history from the Ancients
      through the New Era. Current <cite>Traveller</cite> licensee
      Mongoose Publishing brands modules for the OTU as
      the <a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.mongoosepublishing.com/rpgs/traveller/the-third-imperium.html">"Third
      Imperium"</a> line, to distinguish them from modules for other
      settings adapted to the <cite>Traveller</cite> rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the <a target="_blank"
      href="http://farfuture.net/FFEFairUsePolicy2008.pdf">FFE Fair
      Use Policy</a>, the Traveller Map presents an interactive view
      into the OTU, making use of official data approved and provided
      by FFE &mdash; as well as apocryphal and unofficial data.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h3>Official and Unofficial Data</h3>
    <p>
      The status of a sector's data is called out when the sector is
      clicked or centered in the map view. <i>Official</i> data has no
      annotation - this is data supplied by FFE's Traveller 5 Second
      Survey (T5SS) project. Some data is still <i>In Review</i> and
      further refinements are expected - corrections and feedback is
      appreciated. <i>Unreviewed</i> data was officially published
      data for one of the many prior revisions of
      <cite>Traveller</cite> but has not yet been reviewed by the
      T5SS; it is expected that this data, will become official soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      In contrast, <i>Apocryphal</i> data was formerly supplied by
      <cite>Traveller</cite> licensees but is no longer considered official; all,
      none, or some elements of this data may be retained when
      analyzed by the T5SS. <i>Unofficial</i> data was created by the
      <cite>Traveller</cite> community, including organizations such as HIWG and
      individuals. Mixing official and unofficial data within the
      same map may be concerning to those who want an authoritative,
      unassailable and pure source of truth. Those who are familiar
      with the lore of <cite>Traveller</cite> will recognize that
      truth is a rare commodity and slippery substance, and often
      contains contradictions and unsettling gaps. Even the official
      data is intentionally incomplete, and may contain mistakes,
      secrets, lies and deliberate omissions.

    <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>

  <section id="search">
    <h3>Search Tips</h3>

    <p>
      Use the search field to look up worlds, subsectors, sectors, and
      regions by name. By default, searches use "prefix" search. So
      <code>reg</code> will find the Regina system and the Regina
      subsector, among others.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use <code>*</code> and <code>?</code> as
      wildcards. <code>*</code> matches zero or more characters,
      so <code>*ward</code> will find the Spinward Marches
      sector. <code>?</code> matches exactly one character,
      so <code>t?rra</code> will find the Terra system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specify <code>uwp:</code> to search UWPs. For example,
      <code>uwp:*-g</code> will find tech level 16 worlds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specify <code>pbg:</code> to search PBG. For example,
      <code>pbg:??0</code> will find systems without gas giants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specify <code>zone:</code> to search travel zones,
      using <code>G</code> for "green" or no zone. For example,
      <code>zone:A</code> will find Amber Zone worlds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specify <code>alleg:</code> to search allegiances. For example,
      <code>alleg:Im*</code> will find Imperial worlds (in any domain).
    </p>
    <p>
      Specify <code>remark:</code> to search for remarks/codes. For example,
      <code>remark:Hi</code> will find high-population worlds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specify <code>in:</code> to restrict search to workds in
      a sector. For example,
      <code>uwp:*-f in:Deneb</code> will find tech level 15 worlds
      in Deneb sector.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specify <code>like:</code> to find similar-sounding words. For
      example, <code>like:caboodle</code> will find Capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specify <code>exact:</code> to find exact matches. For example,
      <code>exact:sol</code> will find Sol subsector, but not the
      Solomani Rim sector. You can also surround a word or multiple
      words in quotes like <code>"Nova Terra"</code> to require an
      exact match.
    </p>
    <p>
      Multiple words form an "and" search. For example, <code>sol
      ri</code> will find the Solomani Rim sector, but not the Sol
      subsector. <code>c* uwp:*-f</code> will find all worlds starting
      with C that are tech level 15.

    <h2>How It Works</h2>

    <p>
      The map page is a Web application built using HTML, CSS and
      JavaScript. The page uses script to request image tiles from the
      server. As the map is moved, more tiles are fetched from the
      server, filling in the edges of the map.
    </p>
    <p>
      The server providing the map tiles is running Microsoft's IIS
      with a custom image generation service implemented in C# using
      ASP.NET and GDI+ (via <a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.pdfsharp.net/">PDFsharp</a>) to render the
      tiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The full source code to the site - both client and server - is
      available on <a target="_blank"
      href="https://github.com/inexorabletash/travellermap">GitHub</a>
      and is released under the
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">Apache open source license</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The map data comes from two sources. The macro-scale data -
      comprising the governmental borders and rifts is based on
      classic publications such as the
      <a href="http://travellerbibliography.org/gdw-ct/knownspace.html"
      target="_blank">Imperium Map</a> poster released by GDW in the
      early 1980s. The micro-scale data is derived from sector data
      in <a href="fileformats">".sec" format</a>. Official data from
      the <i>Traveller 5 Second Survey</i> effort is used where
      available.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h3>API</h3>

    <p>
        Most of the data that allows the site to function is exposed
        by various APIs over HTTP and can be used by other sites and
        applications. See the <a href="api">API Documentation</a> for
        more details.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="notes">
    <h3>Design Notes</h3>

    <p>
      The aspect ratio of the map follows the <b><i>Classic
      Traveller</i></b> convention of hexagonal parsecs, so parsecs
      are cos(30&deg;):1 rather than square. This means that the map
      on this site matches the <b><i>Classic Traveller</i></b>
      resources such as the Imperium Map, maps in the Alien Modules,
      the Spinward Marches and Solomani Rim modules, and hexagonal
      subsector maps. The maps may appear distorted when compared with
      square-based maps such as the <cite>Atlas of the Imperium</cite>
      or <b><i>MegaTraveller</i></b>-era publications.
    </p>
    <p>
      When zoomed out to larger scales, the stars are rendered
      pseudo-randomly rather than trying to display the actual system
      data. This maintains the appearance of the Imperium Map poster.
      Rifts are simply left empty. At extremely large scales
      the <a target="_blank"

    <h2>History and More</h2>

    <p>
      This site was inspired by many sources, most prominently some of
      the treasured posessions from my childhood:
      the <a target="_blank"
      href="http://travellerbibliography.org/gdw-ct/knownspace.html">
      Imperium Map poster</a> which provided an overview of known
      space in the <cite>Classic Traveller</cite> era; the Spinward
      Marches poster included with
      <a target="_blank"
      href="http://travellerbibliography.org/gdw-ct/Deluxe.html">Deluxe
      Traveller</a>; and the
      <cite><a target="_blank"
      href="http://travellerbibliography.org/gdw-ct/Atlas.html">Atlas
      of the Imperium</a></cite>, which provided cursory maps of all
      sectors of the Third Imperium.  In the early 1980's, using these
      and the classic Alien Modules, I carefully pieced together a
      <a class="lightbox" target="_blank"
      href="../pictures/Big_Map_1.jpg">map of known space on
      paper</a>.  I also dutifully entered the Sector Generator BASIC
      program into my Apple II and spent endless hours trying to coax
      a decent <a class="lightbox" target="_blank"
      href="../pictures/DotMatrix%20Amdukan.jpg">map from a dot-matrix
      printer</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In early 2005, after a hiatus from <cite>Traveller</cite> of
      nearly 20 years, I purchased a copy of
      the <cite><a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/traveller/core/"> GURPS
      Traveller</a></cite> rulebook, which includes a
      <a class="lightbox" target="_blank"
      href="../pictures/GURPS%20Traveller%20Map.jpg">map of charted
      space within the frame of an imaginary computer-based map
      viewer</a>. I first saw this within weeks of
      <a target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a>
      appearing, and was inspired to create a functional version of
      the map viewer using contemporary Web technologies. I was also
      inspired by the many other online <cite>Traveller</cite> map
      resources and desktop applications such as Jim Vassilakos'
      venerable
      <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Galactic">Galactic</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting in 2013, this site began hosting the official data
      files of the <i>Traveller 5 Second Survey</i> effort, as well as
      older published data and unofficial fan submissions.
