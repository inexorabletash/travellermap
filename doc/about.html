    <h3>About This Site</h3>
    <!-- ================================================================================ -->
    <p>
      The map was inspired by many sources: the <a href="http://travellerbibliography.org/gdw-ct/knownspace.html">
      Imperium Map poster</a> which provided an overview of known space in the <b><i>Classic 
      Traveller</i></b> era; the Spinward Marches poster included with <a href="http://travellerbibliography.org/gdw-ct/Deluxe.html">
      Deluxe Traveller</a>; and the <cite><a href="http://travellerbibliography.org/gdw-ct/Atlas.html">
      Atlas of the Imperium</a></cite>, which provided cursory maps of all 
      sectors of the Third Imperium. Each of these sources are numbered among my 
      treasured posessions from childhood. I carefully pieced together a map with all 
      of the sector names from the classic Alien Modules, and meticulously traced the 
      various borders onto it. (<a href="pictures/Big_Map_1.jpg">See it!</a>) I also 
      dutifully entered the Sector Generator BASIC program into my Apple II and spent 
      endless hours in the 1980s trying to coax a decent map from a 72-DPI dot-matrix 
      printer. (Marc, you rock.)
    </p>
    <p>
      In early 2005, after a hiatus from <b><i>Traveller</i></b> of nearly 20 years, 
      I purchased a copy of the <cite><a href="http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/traveller/core/">
      GURPS Traveller</a></cite> rulebook, which includes a reprint of the 
      Imperium Map poster in showing the map within the frame of an imaginary 
      computer-based map viewer. I first saw this within weeks of <a href="http://maps.google.com">
      Google Maps</a> appearing, and was inspired to create a functional 
      version of the map viewer using contemporary Web technologies. (Loren, you rock 
      too.)
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many other <b><i>Traveller</i></b> map resources on the Internet. 
      Some other Web-based tools make use of static images (such as <a href="http://jtas.net/travelleratlas/index.php">
      The Traveller Atlas</a>), which require significant preparation time by the 
      site author; others use client-side technology (such as the [now offline] <!-- a href="http://www2.magmacom.com/~ehenry/traveller/" -->
      <cite>The Java SubSector Viewer</cite><!-- /a -->). There are also full applications, such as 
      Jim Vassilakos' highly regarded Galactic (downloadable <a href="http://www.vrhome.com/traveller/software.htm">
      here</a>) and commercial applications such as <a href="http://www.trisen.com/sol/default.asp?topic=10&amp;page=47">
      Traveller Universe</a>. This site is a supplement to these other tools; the 
      impressive work by their creators cannot be understated. (They rock as well. 
      I'm just standing on the shoulders of giants here.)

    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <!-- ================================================================================ -->
    <p>
      The map page is constructed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript targetting 
      both the Microsoft Internet Explorer and W3C event models, and has been tested 
      with Internet Explorer 8+, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Safari.
    </p>
    <p>
      The map page uses client side script to request image tiles from the server. 
      The script arranges the tiles in a scrolling container, which is moved when the 
      user drags the map. As the map is dragged, any newly revealed tiles are 
      requested from the server, filling in the edges of the map. (Feel free to look 
      at the page source to see how this works.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The server providing the map tiles is running Microsoft's ASP.NET, with a 
      custom ASPX service generating the images on the fly. The service is coded 
      using C# and makes use of the GDI+ services (via .NET wrappers) to produce 
      high-fidelity rendering.
    </p>
    <p>
      The map data comes from two sources. The macro-scale data - comprising the 
      governmental borders and rifts - was literally traced from the 
      <a href="http://travellerbibliography.org/gdw-ct/knownspace.html" target="_blank">Imperium Map</a> 
      poster released by GDW in the early 1980s by scanning the map and tracing the 
      borders with a mouse into a custom vector format. The micro-scale data is 
      derived from sector data found on the Internet in ".sec" format.
    </p>

    <h3>API</h3>
    <!-- ================================================================================ -->
    <p>
        Most of the data that allows the site to function is exposed by various APIs over
        HTTP. See the <a href="api.htm">API Documentation</a> for more details.
    </p>

    <h3>Design Notes</h3>
    <!-- ================================================================================ -->
    <p>
      The aspect ratio of the map follows the <b><i>Classic Traveller</i></b> convention 
      of hexagonal parsecs, so parsecs are cos(30&deg;):1 rather than square. This 
      means that the map on this site matches the <b><i>Classic Traveller</i></b> resources 
      such as the Imperium Map, maps in the Alien Modules, the Spinward Marches and 
      Solomani Rim modules, and hexagonal subsector maps. The maps may appear 
      distorted when compared with square-based maps such as the <cite>Atlas of the 
        Imperium</cite> or <b><i>MegaTraveller</i></b>-era publications.
    </p>
    <p>
      When zoomed out to larger scales, the stars are rendered pseudo-randomly rather 
      than trying to display the actual system data. This maintains the appearance of 
      the Imperium Map poster. Rifts are simply left empty. At extremely large scales
      and away from Charted Space, the galactic structure is rendered based on
      a galactic map copyright &copy; 2000 Far Future Enterprises, hosted by Clifford Linehan's 
      [now offline] 
      <!-- a href="http://www.geocities.com/traveller_core_route/" --><cite>The Core Route Projects</cite><!-- /a -->.
    </p>
    <p>
      The map features shown at various zoom levels are arbitrary; I settled on them
      by trial and error. Although some view toggles are exposed by the controls, most are 
      hard-coded. Here is a rough guide:
    </p>
        
    <div style="margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 12pt;">
      <table>
        <tr><th>Feature           <th>Min Scale <th>Max Scale

      If you do just one thing with the map, set the scale to 64 (Subsector) and 
      select Regina/Spinward Marches.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do just two things with the map, visit Regina, but also set the scale to 
      16 (Sector) and pan around the Imperium to get a sense of scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do just three things with the map, visit Regina, then pan across the 
      Imperium, but finally set the scale to 64 (Subsector) and select Capital/Core. 
      Then retrace the steps of the Sylean Federation Scout Service, and try to make 
      your way to Vland or Terra. It's a humbling trek.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is lots more that can be done, but for now: enjoy!
