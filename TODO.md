# Work on planetary systems

* Handle base creation.  I'm still not sure how best to handle that given everything:
  * Should the bases be at existing systems
    * My gut says "we don't care"
    * In many cases the ideal location is an empty orbit of something, beit a star or a world but whether that is occupied isnt' something
      we care about
    * If there are no viable empty orbits available then we'll have to colocate with something
  * should the bases target jump-masked systems or open ones?
    * I actually feel that naval bases would be jump-masked from a defensive perspective (surprise attack), wheras
    * scout bases would not be jump masked because of quick turnaround.
    * X-Boat bases are definitely not jump masked and may be outside of M-drive range
