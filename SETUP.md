The Traveller Map - Setup Guide
================================

This is the setup guide to source code behind https://travellermap.com - an online resource for fans
of the Traveller role playing game.

This guide assumes basic familiarity with using Visual Studio projects and the Git source control system.

Prerequisites
-------------
* Windows 10 or later
* [Visual Studio Community 2022](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) or the equivalent
* [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) - or the equivalent

Setup and Build
---------------
1. Clone the source for PDFsharp 1.5:
    * example: `git clone https://github.com/empira/PDFsharp-1.5`
2. Using Visual Studio, open `PDFsharp\code\BuildAll-PdfSharp.sln`, select the Release target, and build.
3. Clone this repository:
    * example: `git clone https://github.com/inexorabletash/travellermap.git`
4. In your clone, copy the included `web.config.sample` file to `web.config`
5. Using Visual Studio, open `Maps.sln`
6. In the Solution Explorer pane, in both the Maps project and the UnitTests project, delete and re-add the references to PdfSharp to point to the PDFSharp DLL you just built (`PDFsharp-1.5\src\PdfSharp-gdi\bin\Release\PdfSharp-gdi.dll`)
7. Optionally, modify the `web.config` file in the solution:
    * Add an _admin key_ - this can be used to trigger flushing of the memory cache and rebuilding the search index.
    * Find the `<sessionState>` element and the `stateConnectionString` attribute; change `50103` to your local IISExpress port number. Find this by opening the Maps project's properties and looking for the Web tab, "Servers" subsection, Project URL box (mine says `http://localhost:50103/` for example).
8. Select the Debug or Release target and build the Maps target.

Trying it out
-------------
* You can run it however you like; I use **Ctrl+F5** to start without debugging.
* IIS will start and your default browser will connect to the site.
* The map will display!

To Add a Database
-----------------

Some features such as search require a database.

1. Ensure you have some version of SQL Server installed (Express, Developer, etc). [SQL Server Downloads](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)
1. Track down the **connection string** for the database. When installing SQL Server Express Edition, this is given at the end of the install, and looks like: `Server=localhost\SQLEXPRESS;Database=master;Trusted_Connection=True;`
1. Open the Solution > Maps > `Web.config` file and find the `<connectionStrings>` element
1. Paste your copied connection string information from the properties panel into the `connectionString` attribute of both the `SqlDev` and `SqlProd` names
1. Save your `Web.config`

Now that your application can find your empty database, the reindex action on the admin page will fill an empty database:

1. Start the site; I use **Ctrl+F5** to start without debugging.
1. Your browser will open to the default page, `http://localhost:<YOUR_PORT>/index.htm`
1. Edit the URL to load: `http://localhost:<YOUR_PORT>/admin/reindex`

You will see output from the re-indexing operation; when complete the page will show a summary followed by a little Omega symbol (&Omega;) at the bottom of the page.

To verify that the database is populated, you can run a query:

* `http://localhost:<YOUR_PORT>/api/search?q=regina`

> NOTE: When the Debug build target is running, only the worlds in "selected" sectors will be indexed. A Release build will index all worlds.
