# Milieu 1900
This is the star data at the end of the Pastoral Period (1350-1900),
just before the dawn of the Galaxiad Era.

This file provides just a little bit of context for you, gentle reader.

# It Started Before the Wave
Of course, the Ancients knew about the Wave long before it hit Charted Space.
They watched the Vilani and Geonee develop their jump drives, and took time to 
study these sophonts before the Wave showed up. They even used sophonts to do
some targeted surveys of parts of the galaxy; they shot them near and far,
on colonial-exploration missions.

Essentially: go to that bright star, which by the way is a quarter of the 
galaxy distant. Check it out and report back in 11,000 years (i.e. after
the Wave has already passed by.)

# Why This Matters
Portions of the Galaxiad form the Introduction to the setting.  Therefore, we
need to be equipped with enough background data to enjoy it.

In order to make revelations of the setting fun, the "known secrets" have to
be presented before the setting is introduced -- if possible. 

For example, one of those is already circulating, and that's the Black Fleets 
and the Red Nodes.

This star data is another early introduction to the setting.

# What's Next?
Roughly these are items that fall after the setting has "started", whatever
that means.

## Formal End of the Pastoral Era
This involves the Vilani, the Republic, and other sophonts, and should be 
given a framing event. As evidenced in Agent of the Imperium, that event 
would trigger involvement by the Vilani, who would presumably be the curator
of forgotten or lost data that helps develop the setting further, via
data dump.

## Then Pace 
Introduce other elements, such as:

### Hop Drive
### Abyssals
### Denizens
### Core Sophonts
### Core Expedition
### Anomaly One
### Essaray
### The Barren Arm

# The Vilani Scout Service
They have always supported a Scout Service. Is there a reason why? Were they
also scouting ahead for the same reasons the Ancients did?

This also feeds into the Far Flung Vilani Colonies, as well as the anomalies 
and segments of the galaxy mentioned in Agent as well as T5 Book 3 page 9.
