# Milieu 1900
This is the star data at the end of the Pastoral Period (1350-1900), just before the dawn of the Galaxiad Era.

This file provides just a little bit of context for you, gentle reader.

# It Started Before the Wave
Of course, the Ancients knew about the Wave long before it hit Charted Space. They watched the Vilani and Geonee develop their jump drives, and took time to study these sophonts before the Wave showed up. They even used sophonts to do some targeted surveys of parts of the galaxy; they shot them near and far, on colonial-exploration missions.

Essentially: go to that bright star, which by the way is a quarter of the galaxy distant. Check it out and report back in 11,000 years (i.e. after
the Wave has already passed by.)

# The Scout Service
You think it's coincidence that the Vilani (and the Imperium afterward) maintained an official Scout Service and established scout bases all across
their empires?

The Vilani have always supported a Scout Service. Is there a reason why? Were they also scouting ahead for the same reasons the Ancients did?

The halo of sparse settlement and Jump-possessing societies around Charted Space is *enormous*, and a lot of it is apparently Vilani in origin or cause.  While half of the modern era of jump drive has been limited to Jump-1, that looks to be much less of an impediment than originally thought. Vilani, whether on purpose or by accident, are halfway to the core, possibly *beyond* the core, 90 degrees around the galactic disk to trailing, and selling drives to multiple races years away along the Great Rift.  So...how and when?

This also feeds into the Far Flung Vilani Colonies, as well as the anomalies and segments of the galaxy mentioned in Agent as well as T5 Book 3 page 9. The Vilani missions eventually seed colonies, ex-pats, castaways, and war factories all over the galaxy. Many of them never report back, but enough do to feed Vland's desire to keep the whole affair secret.  The upshot is that certain elements of the Vilani have been working with the Ancients for thousands of years, and have known about both the Waves and the Black Ships the whole time.

# Why This Matters
Portions of the Galaxiad form the Introduction to the setting.  This data equips us with enough background data to enjoy said setting.

In order to make revelations of the setting fun, the "known secrets" have to be presented before the setting is introduced -- if possible. 

For example, one of those is already circulating, and that's the black fleets, courtesy Agent of the Imperium and its associated short story, The Red Node.

This star data is another early introduction to the setting.

# What's Next?
Then there are items that fall after the setting has been inaugurated.

## Formal End of the Pastoral Era
This involves the Vilani, the Republic, and other sophonts. The formal end and beginning involves the Vilani, who would presumably be the curator
of useful data or equipment that helps develop the setting further.  It involves the Republic of Regina, because Spinward Marches.  And it involves
sophonts, because they too survived -- or died -- with history.

## Then Pace 
Introduce other elements mentioned but apparently upcoming, such as:

### Hop Drive
### Abyssals
### Denizens
### Core Sophonts
### Core Expedition
### Anomaly One
### Essaray
### The Barren Arm
### Dushis Khurisi and other far-flung Vilani colonies
